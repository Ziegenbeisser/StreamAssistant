# StreamAssistant

## Welcome 
This is the Home to my pet project and the Software i use when im Streaming over at [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/vankashtv).
It started out as a little commandline exe that would assist with TTS on my channel and grew the functionality of Controller Interruptions through chat messages,
this demanded on-the-fly changes so i needed to move away from something static and something that let's me quickly edit methods. That's why we have a UI.
